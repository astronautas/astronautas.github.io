title: On using UV for one year
---

UV was the best thing that had happened to Python. Some thoughts on one year of using it.

<!--more-->

 I have switched to UV for all of my Python project's (both legacy and new ones), over the last full year. It has many interesting features, but I've narrowed down 3 making it a bliss to use it.

### Python management

Not only UV can install dependencies, but can also install Python. Great dev-ex, one command for both. An example - I constantly switch between 3 Python apps, all with different Python versions. With UV, I can go to project's dir, run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests
```

and it <u>installs / switches to project's Python</u>. Infers straight from `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.14"
```

`uv run` will pull-in Python 3.13, at most. No need for a separate tool like pyenv, on top pyenv [does not understand](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1233) `pyproject.toml`'s Python.

### Speed

It's fast. Faster than pip, or frankly any package manager. It feels <u>real-time</u>. Because of Rust™. Speed is rarely a tradeoff (from a user point of view).

### Ad-hoc virtual envs / script mode

A year ago I thought [this one was a killer feature](https://valatka.dev/2025/01/12/on-killer-uv-feature.html). Putting it last though, I used it a few times. Nontheless, cool. Here's a situation I had - I was debugging some parallel http calls, it was convenient to just run the script with:

```bash
uvx --python 3.13 --with pandas test_concurrent_calls.py
```

A difference from a year ago - change `uv -> uvx`, to leave no venv trace. Neat, right? 

### Cons?
I've yet to find any. Once I couldn't install some Torch dependency because UV kept insisting incompatibility with my system. That's useful though, but I knew what I was doing and got blocked. Conda packages? Unsupported, but didn't need those, at least for production apps.

To another year - now, please improve (speed of) [type checking](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) 🐍.
