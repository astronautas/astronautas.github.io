title: Reflecting on using UV for one year
---

uv was the best thing that had happened to Python. Some thoughts on one year of using it.

<!--more-->

 I have been using UV package manager for all of my Python projects for over a one year now. Here are a few features that I love most about uv:

### Python management

Not only UV can install dependencies, but can also install Python. Great dev-ex, one command for both. An example - I constantly switch between 3 Python apps, all with different Python versions. With uv, I can go to project's dir, run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests
```

and it <u>installs / switches to project's Python</u>. Infers straight from `pyproject.toml`. No need for a separate tool like pyenv, on top pyenv [does not understand](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1233) `pyproject.toml`'s Python.

### Speed

It's fast. Faster than pip, or frankly any package manager. It feels <u>real-time</u>. Because of Rust™. Speed is rarely a tradeoff (from a user point of view).

### Run a script with dependencies

I originally posted about this [here](https://valatka.dev/2025/01/12/on-killer-uv-feature.html). Frankly, I've used the feature, at least a few times. I recall I was debugging some parallel http calls, it was convenient to just run the script with:

```bash
uvx --python 3.13 --with pandas my_script.py
```

A difference from a year ago - change `uv -> uvx`, to leave no venv trace. Neat!

### Cons?
I've yet to find any. Once I couldn't install some Torch dependency because uv kept insisting incompatibility with my system. That's useful though, but I knew what I was doing and got blocked. Conda packages? Unsupported, but didn't need those, at least for production apps.

To another year - now, please improve [type checking](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) 🐍.
