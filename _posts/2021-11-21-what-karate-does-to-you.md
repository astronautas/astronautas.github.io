# What Karate Does to You

I have been practicing Karate for nearly 2 years now. Why would you do it though? Many people would say for self-defence.

Let's take the roundhouse kick (jap. mavashi-geri), for example. It's a powerful move. Contrary to a popular belief though, the roundhouse kick sucks - it does not work in close combat, a more capable grappler could grab you by the legs. Most Karate branches e.g. Kyokushin, sport Shotokan, and most western schools suffer from putting too much focus on the competition aspect. To win tournaments, you have to obey rules, as well as impress the jury. High kicks, artificial hits to sensitive body parts get medals, but don't help that much in a street fight.

For self-defence, Krav-Maga, MMA, Sambo, BJJ should get the job done faster, and better.

Does it make you stronger? Yes! Over the years, I have become physically fit, thanks to Karate. It is a great way to increase power, strength, endurance, mobility.

Karate aims for something different. I would dare to say, far more ambitious - to develop the spirit.

<- shorten this one.

To start with, Karate teaches patience. Patience is a virtue nowadays. Karate is slow. There is a high focus on preciness, repetition, mastery. Most moves come with a prerequisite of great physical condition and mobility, otherwise you have to learn to do them properly to compensate.

For example, kicks require either hell of a  mobility or learning proper swing movement.

It also teaches humbleness. Black belts practice with white belts. They repeat same basic techniques (kihon) over and over again. Although it may seem wasteful, Japanese culture encourages perfection. 

To illustrate, most of the guys I practice with are either  brown or black belts. They have 5 - 10 years of Karate experience. We practice moves that they learned many years ago, together - basic punches, kicks, throws, grapples. It is humbling.

Let's put all of this together. Karate develops one's spirit. Through gruelling practice it instils patience. It teaches humbleness, since no matter the rank, all peers are equal.

Funny thing is, I never had issues with aforementioned personal qualities. It is natural to me for things to take time, to work on long-term goals. I believe everyone has something to teach others. Hierarchy e.g. in a professional life is just a just different sort of specialization i.e. focusing on the strategic level vs. the tactical level. Why do I do it then?

The other day I had an interesting chat with a Karate Dojo owner. I am not exactly how it all began, but we drifted towards discussing my sensei, which shed a bit of light on what makes him succesful.

Joe told me that sensei is always on the run. I didn't surprise me . I heard he delivers leaderhip seminars for local businesses. He's a referee, being often away for competition. He sees an opportunity, and he seizes it. Such a lifestyle comes at a cost - often sensei everything at a last minute. 

Joe told a bizzare story, that once sensei forgot about a leadership seminar, which was to take place in an hour. He was immersed into a vast array of endevours, that he totally forgot about the speech. He put a couple of slides and nailed the speech.

"If there is one thing that Karate aims to develop, is to do you best without a proper plan at hand."

Traditional Karate has an ambition to develop ability to perform exceptionally under time pressure. You have under a second to come up with a plan to:

* Disable an attack.
* Disable the attacker.

Years of practicing such situations equips you with a mindset to execute ruthlessly when there is no time to plan.
