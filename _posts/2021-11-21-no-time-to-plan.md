Reflecting on the art of acing without a thought-out plan.

<!--more-->

The other day I had a chat with a local Karate dojo owner. I am not exactly sure how it all began, but we drifted towards discussing my sensei. He is a busy bee.

The sensei is always on the run, having many activities alongside being the master of the dojo. He delivers leadership seminars for businesses. He is also a referee, being often away abroad for competitions. He sees an opportunity, and he seizes it. It comes at a cost. Often sensei does everything at the last minute. 

We talked over a funny story of his. Once sensei forgot about a leadership seminar. In less than an hour, he had to deliver a presentation to senior leads of an international bank. He was immersed in such a vast array of endeavors, that the presentation slipped out of his memory. He put a couple of slides and nailed the speech.

> Karate is a great whole-body sport. It teaches patience and humbleness. But the one quality that Karate aims to develop is to ace without a thought-out plan at hand.

Looking forward to the upcoming years of practicing the art!
