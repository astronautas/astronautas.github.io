        <p>My name is Lukas. I am a software engineer who loves using data and machine learning to tackle today's most challenging issues.</p>
        <p>I build software for the entire lifecycle of machine learning. I design models, as well as work on MLOps, to deliver scalable, reliable and effective systems that learn and adapt.</p>
        <p>I currently help <a href="https://www.vinted.fr/" target="_blank">Vinted</a> recommend the most relevant second-hand clothing to millions of users. In the past, 
        I designed <a href="https://neurotechnology.com/" target="_blank">autonomous mobile robots</a>.</p>
        <p>I am a Traditional Karate-do practitioner as well, and too much of a history nerd.</p>
        <p>I reside in Vilnius, Lithuania, at the moment.</p>
